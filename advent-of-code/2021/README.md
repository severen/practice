# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

The language I have chosen to implement my solutions in this year is
[Haskell](https://haskell.org/).

To run a solution, enter the `haskell` directory, build the program with `ghc`,
and then run it. For example:

```sh
$ cd haskell
$ ghc --make -O2 day01.hs
$ ./day01
```

Alternatively, `runhaskell` can be used to directly run a program using GHC's bytecode
interpreter (beware: performance will be worse).
